To generate an RRHO, every gene in each gene list should have a log fold change and a p-value associated to it. This test does not consider a fold change or a p-value cutoff.

Next, top 17 genes from gene list 1 and top 34 genes in gene list 2 are considered, and hypergeometric test is used to find the significance. This step is carried out until we are through all 289 genes, and obtain 289 p-value measurements.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></span><u>Gene list 1</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Gene list 2</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p-value</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">17 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">17 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 34 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">17 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">34 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">34 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 34 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">34 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;..</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">289 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 289 genes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ..</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">We use this list of p-values to fill the RRHO matrix, starting from the bottom left corner.
