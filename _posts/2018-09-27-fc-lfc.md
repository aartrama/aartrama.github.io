Selecting genes from a DGE list which show at least 30% increase or decrease in expression (compared to control) can be confusing if one uses the log fold change values. One can follow the following procedure instead:

<br> 
**Case 1 - 30% Increase**

Let's assume the expression of gene X is 10 in condition A (control) and 13 in condition B. In this case, gene X is upregulated and there is a 30% increase in expression ($$ \frac{13-10}{10} $$).

 - foldChange = $$ \frac{13}{10} $$ = 1.3 <br>
 - log2FoldChange = log2($$ \frac{13}{10} $$) = 0.378.

One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of 0.378 (and above) to obtain genes that are up-regulated with at least 30% increase. 

<br>
**Case 2 - 30% Decrease**

Assuming the expression of gene X is 10 in condition A (control) and 7 in condition B, gene X is downregulated and there is a 30% decrease in expression.

 - foldChange = $$ \frac{7}{10} $$ = 0.7 <br> 
 - log2FoldChange = log2($$ \frac{7}{10} $$) = -0.514.

One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of -0.514 (and below) to obtain genes that are down-regulated with at least 30% decrease.

<br>
**Converting log2FoldChange to foldChange**

2<sup>log2FoldChange</sup> = foldChange<br>
eg. 2<sup>-0.514</sup> = 0.7
