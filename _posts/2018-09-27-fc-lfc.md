In an RNA-seq experiment, obtaining genes which have 30% increase or 30% decrease in expression (compared to a control group) can be confusing if one uses just the log2FoldChange values. It is best to convert it to foldChange before extracting the genes. 

**Case 1 - Upregulation**

Expression of gene X in condition A = 10; 
Expression of gene X in condition B = 13

In this case, gene X is upregulated.

foldChange = 13/10 = 1.3; 
log2FoldChange = log2(13/10) = 0.378

Since the expression of gene X in condition A is 10, and gene X in condition B is 13, there is a 30% increase in expression. One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of 0.378 (and above) to obtain up-regulated genes with 30% increase.

**Case 2 - Downregulation**

Expression of gene X in condition A = 10; 
Expression of gene X in condition B = 7

In this case, gene X is downregulated.

foldChange = 7/10 = 0.7; 
log2FoldChange = log2(7/10) = -0.514

Since the expression of gene X in condition A is 10, and gene X in condition B is 7, there is a 30% decrease in expression. One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of -0.514 (and below) to obtain down-regulated genes with 30% decrease.

**To convert log2FoldChange back to foldChange**

2^log2FoldChange = foldChange

eg. 2^-0.514 = 0.7

  {% if page.previous.url %}
    <a class="previous" href="{{page.previous.url}}">&laquo; {{page.previous.title}}</a>
  {% endif %}
  {% if page.next.url %}
    <a class="next" style="float:right" href="{{page.next.url}}">{{page.next.title}} &raquo;</a>
  {% endif %}
</div>
