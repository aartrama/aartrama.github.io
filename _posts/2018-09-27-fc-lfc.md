Obtaining genes from an RNA-seq DE list which have at least 30% increase or 30% decrease in expression (compared to control) can be confusing if one considers the log fold change values. One can select the genes as follows:

<br> 

**Case 1 - Upregulation**

Expression of gene X in condition A (control) = 10 and expression of gene X in condition B = 13

In this case, gene X is **upregulated**. 

foldChange = 13/10 = 1.3 and log2FoldChange = log2(13/10) = 0.378

Since the expression of gene X in condition A is 10, and the expression of gene X in condition B is 13, there is a 30% increase in expression ((13-10)/10). One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of 0.378 (and above) to obtain genes that are up-regulated with at least 30% increase. 

<br>

**Case 2 - Downregulation**

Expression of gene X in condition A (contro) = 10 and expression of gene X in condition B = 7

In this case, gene X is **downregulated**.

foldChange = 7/10 = 0.7 and log2FoldChange = log2(7/10) = -0.514

Since the expression of gene X in condition A is 10, and the expression of gene X in condition B is 7, there is a 30% decrease in expression. One may use a log2FoldChange threshold of -0.514 (and below) to obtain genes that are down-regulated with at least 30% decrease.

<br>

**Converting log2FoldChange to foldChange**

2^log2FoldChange = foldChange

eg. 2^-0.514 = 0.7

<div class="Previous-next">
  {% if page.previous.url %}
    <a class="previous" href="{{page.previous.url}}">&laquo; {{page.previous.title}}</a>
  {% endif %}
  {% if page.next.url %}
    <a class="next" style="float:right" href="{{page.next.url}}">{{page.next.title}} &raquo;</a>
  {% endif %}
</div>
