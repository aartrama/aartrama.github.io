Although a little outdated, this article explains the difference between using Input and IgG as a control for ChIP-seq analysis well:

[Getting started with ChIP seq](https://epigenie.com/guide-getting-started-with-chip-seq/){:target="_blank"}

The following biostars links are useful too:

* [Input, Igg Or Untagged Strain](https://www.biostars.org/p/15817/){:target="_blank"}
* [Which ChIP-seq IgG to use](https://www.biostars.org/p/215222/){:target="_blank"}
* [control used (IgG/Input)](https://www.biostars.org/p/300621/]){:target="_blank"}

Input samples are generally preferred over IgG, as they work best while using MACS for peak calling.
