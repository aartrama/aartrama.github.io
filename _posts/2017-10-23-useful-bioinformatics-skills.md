Following are some Bioinformatics skills which I feel every Bioinformatician should be aware of -

1. [Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/){:target="_blank"} containerization

2. Git and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/){:target="_blank"} (Yes, these are two different things)

3. Proficiency with working in a cloud environment (Amazon Web services)

4. Pandas and NumPy in Python, to use the concept of 'vectorization' instead of using 'for' loops while coding

5. Using lapply, sapply instead of for loops in R

6. Building a Bioinformatics pipeline using existing workflow management systems such as [Snakemake](http://slowkow.com/notes/snakemake-tutorial/){:target="_blank"}, Ruffus etc.

7. Creation of simple apps using Rshiny

8. Some basic [Machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning){:target="_blank"} knowledge using matlab and scikitlearn

9. Learn testing of code using unittest in Python and RUnit in R

10. Installation of tools and creation of environments using Anaconda and Bioconda

11. A basic understanding of the concepts behind Bioinformatics tools

12. jupyter notebooks
